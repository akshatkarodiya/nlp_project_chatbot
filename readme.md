First Step

for chatbot most important part is to understand the  intent. Intent is the intention of the users, interacting wiht the chatbot.
 
 We use a supervised learning approach of training an sentence classifier i.e we classify the intent in the classes or entities. Entities are the objects/topics useful in further knowing the purpose of User's inputs.

Examples :- 

intent : greet => examples: hey hi hello etc.

intent : read with entity: book
examples: I would like to read a book.
